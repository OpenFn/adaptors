The adaptors wiki is a living technical guide to developing OpenFn adaptors.

It is targeted at technical users and assumes some level of JavaScript competency.

Every page of the wiki should be considered a work-in-progress. We revise content frequently and welcome contributions.

The wiki includes general guides and technical details around the construction and design of adaptors, as well as tips, tricks and development aides to make life easier.
