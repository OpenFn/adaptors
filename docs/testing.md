explain how unit tests and integration tests work


There are two types of test which serve different purposes;

* Unit Tests are tightly scoped tests which execute specific functions in isolation. The smaller a unit of code is tested, the better the test. We would expect one unit test per operation (usually against the implementation, rather than the operation)
*  Integration tests are broadly scoped tests against multiple operations. These look like actual job code and are executed against the actual Openfn Runtime
