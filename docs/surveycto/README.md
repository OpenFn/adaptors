## sample configuration

```js
{
  "username": "taylor@openfn.org",
  "password": "supersecret",
  "instanceName": "openfn_test"
}
```

## fetchSubmissions
`fetchSubmissions(1,2,3)` takes three arguments:

1. the `formId` of the form on SurveyCTO

2. the `initialAfterDate`, a date string or UNIX timestamp which instructs the job to only fetch submissions after a certain date. After the first run of the job, subsequent runs will only fetch *NEW* submissions.

3. the `postUrl` is where the wide-format JSON representation of each form submission should be sent. Note that a `formId` key will be added to each form submission for later filtering/routing.

### sample `fetchSubmissions` expression

```js
fetchSubmissions(
  // formId on SurveyCTO server
  "household_survey",
  // initialAfterDate: this will only be accessed if "lastSubmissionDate" is empty in your job_state".
  // After the initial run of the job, OpenFn will only pull new submissions from SurveyCTO.
  "Aug 29, 2016 4:44:26 PM",
  // postUrl is where you want to send the JSON submissions, appended with a new "formId" key
  "https://www.openfn.org/inbox/secret-inbox-uuid"
)
```
