# OpenFn Adaptors ![Build & Test](https://github.com/openfn/adaptors/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main) ![Build & Test](https://github.com/openfn/adaptors/actions/workflows/docs.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The new home for all @openfn
[language adaptors](https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors) - open-source Javascript
or Typescript modules that provide helper functions to communicate with a
specific external system.

For a fully open source workflow automation platform that leverages these
adaptors, see [OpenFn Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning).

## Getting Started

_Note: [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to be installed globally on your
machine. Add the nodejs and pnpm plugin once asdf is installed globally._

A few first time repo steps:

```
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
asdf plugin-add pnpm
```

Then:

```
asdf install # Install tool versions
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm run setup
```

## Running scripts

Every repo provides a common set of npm scripts:

To run them for all scripts in `packages`, call
`pnpm --filter "./packages/** <script>`.

For example:

```
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" build
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" test
```

### Working with adaptors

#### Requirements

- Create a fork of this repo on your local machine
- Iinstall the OpenFn CLI `npm install -g @openfn/cli`
- Ensure the OPENFN_REPO_DIR env var is set to to the root of this repo, ie,
  `export OPENFN_REPO_DIR=~/repo/openfn/cli-repo`
- Ensure you have the logo images of the adaptor you need to create: a rectangle
  512x190px and a square-256x256px

#### 1. Setup

Generating a new adaptor. Run this from the repo root:

```
pnpm generate <adaptor-name>
```

- Add the logo images in the assets folder inside the generated adaptor folder.
  Ps: Ensure both images are named rectangle.png and square.png respectively and
  adhere to the size specifications mentioned in the requirements section.
- Ensure the mages have a transparent background. Navigate to
  configuration-schema.json, and change any configs that do not align with the
  adaptor
- Go to `/src/Adaptor.js` and create the adaptor’s Operations - the functions
  used in job code. You may want to set up `POST, GET,` to fit the current
  adaptor’s requirements

They should look something like this:

```js
export function yourFunctionName(arguments) {
  return state => {
    // logic
    return state;
  };
}
```

- Go to `src/Utils.js` and change the code in the file to match your desired
  implementation. Any internal functions used by your adaptor, but not by job
  code, should go here in Utils.js
- Update the readme with correct examples that match your new implementation
- Write and update the tests within the `/tests` folder
- Edit the CHANGELOG.md file with comments about the initial release.
- You should set your credentials in the “configuration” property inside
  `state.json`
- Write some unit tests to ensure your code works

#### 2. Test it manually

To run a test job and exercise your

- Create a new /tmp folder and create two new files: state.json and
  expression.js.
- - Note that the /tmp folder is already gitignored and will not be sent to
    gitHub when you push your code.
- Write a test job inside `expression.js`
- Navigate to the adaptor folder:

```
cd packages/<adaptor name>
```

- Install adaptor dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

- Build the adaptor

```
pnpm build --watch
```

- Run the test job through the CLI

```
openfn tmp/expression.js -ma <adaptor name> -o tmp/output.json -s tmp/state.json

```

`-o` will output to your console

`-m` will run the job from the monorepo (see the setup notes in 1.)

`-a` this will specify the adaptor to run your job with

The different output from you running the jobs will be temporarily stored in
`output.json`

#### 3. Add docs and write the tests

- Include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comments to provide a clear and
  comprehensive explanation of the adaptor function's purpose, parameters,
  return values, and usage examples
- Update the adaptor's `README.md` to include a sample operation

## Changesets

Any submitted PRs should have an accompanying
[`changeset`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

A changeset is a text file with a list of what you've changed and a short
summary. Changesets are stored in a temporary folder until a release, at which
point they are merged into the changelogs of the affected packges.

Adding a changeset is really easy thanks to a very friendly CLI.

To create a changeset, run this from the repo root:

```
pnpm changeset
```

Look in the `.changesets` folder to see your change.

Commit the changeset to the repo when you're ready.

Note that the newly generated adaptor should ideally never have its version
increased - it should be locked at `1.0.0`.

## Releases

New releases will be published to npm automatically when merging into the `main`
branch`.

Version numbers should be bumped with `changeset` and git tags should be pushed
to the release branch BEFORE merging.

1. Run `pnpm run version` from root to bump versions and add release dates
1. Run `pnpm install`
1. Commit the new version numbers
1. Push the branch

When the branch is merged to main, Github Actions will:

- Build and test (just in case)
- Publish any new version numbers to npm
- Generate and push tags for all new versions
- Send a notification to slack
- Update `docs/docs.json` with new markdown and update docs.openfn.org

## Pre-releases

**NOTE: pre-release automation is currently DISABLED until support is activated
in Lightning**

Pre-release builds for adaptors are available with the `@next` tag. These can be
used in the CLI and Lightning and are generally available on `npm` (but because
they're not flagged as `latest`, they won't be downloaded by default).

Old pre-release versions will be deprecated when a new tag is published.

Pre-releases are available for any non-draft PR with at least one changeset.

The pre-release build will be updated when:

- A PR is opened in a non-draft state
- A new commit is pushed
- A changeset is added

Pre-releases will be given the correct next version number (the number that
`pnpm changeset version` will generated), plus the suffix `-next-<sha>`, where
sha is teh short github SHA for the commit.

Note that the Worker and CLI will both always download the latest versions of
the adaptor with the `@next` tag - it's a rolling tag and should always be up to
date.

## Build tooling

The `build` command accepts a list of build steps as arguments: `ast`, `src`,
`docs` and `dts`. Calling build on an adaptor with no arguments will build
everything.

Add `--watch` to watch the `src` for changes and rebuild this dist. This is
useful when developing with the CLI.

You can also watch with `build docs`, ie:

```
pnpm -C adaptors/http build docs --watch
```

Each adaptor's build command should simply call `build-adaptor` with the package
name.

You can run `build --help` for more information.

Examples:

```
pnpm -C packages/salesforce build --watch
```

### Docs

Docs are generated from the JSDoc annotations in adaptors. They are output as
markdown files in the `./docs` directly and not checked in to source control.

The markdown output can be customized by overriding the built-in handlebars
templates in jsoc2md.

- Find the template you want to customise in [j2sdoc2md source()
  https://github.com/jsdoc2md/dmd/tree/master/partials) (this can be tricky)
- Copy the template contents
- Paste into a file with the same name (this is important) in
  `tools/build/src/partials`
- Edit `tools/build/src/commands/docs.ts` and add the path to your new template
  to jsdoc2md's `renderOpts` (see how the other .hbs files are loaded in)
- Make your changes
- Run `pnpm build docs` from root (or just one adaptor folder) and inspect the
  generated `docs/index/md` file.

Once built, the docs need to be compiled into a JSON file to be published to the
docs site. This is run automatically through github actions.

For local dev against the docsite, you can run `pnpm docs:build` to rebuild your
local `docs.json` file. Use `pnpm docs:watch` to watch for md changes in
packages/\* and rebuild automatically.

## Metadata

Check the Wiki for the metadata creation guide:
[https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/Magic-Metadata](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/Magic-Metadata)

There are two CLI utils you can run to generate metadata and populate mock data.

Use `generate` to create a metadata.json based on the provided config. This will
be saved to `packages/<adaptorName>/src/meta/metadata.json`.

Use `populate-mock` to execute the `populate-mock-data.js` file and save the
results into the meta/data dir. Unit tests will use this mock data.

```
pnpm metadata generate <adaptorName> <path/to/config> pnpm metadata
populate-mock <adaptorName> <path/to/config>
```

Config paths can point to JSON or JS files with a default export. They are
always specified relative to the adaptor directory.

You can run these from the repo root or from the adaptor folder.

## Migration Guide

Any old adaptors should be copied/cloned into this repo, with all build, lint
and git artifacts removed and the package.json updated.

This checklist walks you through the process.

**IMPORTANT**: before starting the migration process, please make sure all open
pull-requests are merged or closed (maybe discuss with authors / responsibles)

First, create a new branch for your work:

```
git checkout -b migrate\_<name>
```

Then, copy the adaptor into `packages/<name>` (ignoring the `language-` prefix,
ie, `language-http` -> `http`). You can `cd` into `package` and `git clone`
straight from github if you like.

Next, from the `adaptors` root folder, run the migration script:

```
pnpm migrate <name>
```

For example, `pnpm migrate http`.

Then, from inside your new `packages/<name>`:

- Remove the `.git` directory
- Commit your changes `git commit -am "cloned <name> into monorepo"`
- Delete `package-lock.json`
- Remove `bundledDependencies` from package.json
- Make sure `"rimraf": "^3.0.2"` is in `devDependencies`
- Fix index.js (see `index.js` below)
- Run `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm build`
- Remove the `docs` and `lib` dirs
- Remove `.prettierrc`
- Remove any references to `babel` (ie, `.babelrc`) and `esdoc` (ie,
  `esdoc.json`)
- Remove the `.gitignore` file (update the top level ignore if necessary)
- Remove the `Makefile`
- Remove the `.devcontainer`
- Remove the `.tool-versions`
- Rename `crendential-schema.json` file to `configuration-schema.json`
- Remove the all files related to Travis CI (`travis.yml`, `.travis.yml`, ...)
- Update the readme (see the `Readme` below)
- Fix unit tests (see `Tests` below)
- run `git add packages/<name>` from the root folder to allow pnpm to detect
  `<name>` as changed package
- run `pnpm changeset` from the repo root to register a changeset (add a minor
  version bump for the package).
- Commit your changes, including the changeset, and open a pull request against
  `main`.

**IMPORTANT**:

- Make sure all open issues are transfered to the
  `https://github.com/openfn/adaptors` repositiory and labelled as the name of
  the source adaptor name. For example issues coming from `language-postgres`
  should have the label `postgres`.
- Update the adaptor repository readme to add archive note
- Archive the adaptor if you can
- Update the adaptor readme to indicate where the package has been moved to
  adaptors repo. See example below

```
# _⚠️ MOVED TO [OpenFn/adaptors](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors)! ⚠️_

**N.B.: New versions are available at:
https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/tree/main/packages/<name>**

# Language <name> (Archived)
```

### index.js

The index.js file should be exactly this:

```

import \* as Adaptor from './Adaptor'; export default Adaptor;

export \* from './Adaptor';

```

The first two lines export the Adaptor object as the default export from the
module, so you can do `import common from '@openfn/common'`

The second line exports every export of Adaptor from the main index, so you can
do `import { fn } from '@openfn/common'`.

### Readme

The readme probably has a section called "Development".

Replace this section with:

```
## Development

Clone the [adaptors monorepo](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors). Follow the
`Getting Started` guide inside to get set up.

Run tests using `pnpm run test` or `pnpm run test:watch`

Build the project using `pnpm build`.

To just build the docs run `pnpm build docs`

```

In addition, you may need to replace any references to `npm` with `pnpm`

### Tests

You'll need to update tests and get them passing.

Instead of importing test files from `lib`, import directly from `src`.

Ie, replace `import Adaptor from '../lib/Adaptor'` becomes
`import Adaptor from '../src/Adaptor'`
