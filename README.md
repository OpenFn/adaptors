# OpenFn Adaptors ![Build & Test](https://github.com/openfn/adaptors/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main) ![Build & Test](https://github.com/openfn/adaptors/actions/workflows/docs.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The new home for all @openfn
[language adaptors](https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors) - open-source Javascript
or Typescript modules that provide helper functions to communicate with a
specific external system.

For a fully open source workflow automation platform that leverages these
adaptors, see [OpenFn Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning).

## Getting Started

_Note: [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to be installed globally on your
machine. Add the nodejs and pnpm plugin once asdf is installed globally._

A few first time repo steps:

```
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
asdf plugin-add pnpm
```

Then:

```
asdf install # Install tool versions
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm run setup
```

## Running scripts

Every repo provides a common set of npm scripts:

To run them for all scripts in `packages`, call
`pnpm --filter "./packages/** <script>`.

For example:

```
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" build
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" test
```

   [fork it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

2. Make your changes by following the
   [working with adaptors](#working-with-adaptors) section.

3. Open a draft PR, fill out the pull request template (this will be added
   automatically for you) then make sure to self-review your code and go through
   the 'Review checklist'. Leave any notes for the reviewer in the 'Details'
   section.

4. Mark the pull request as ready for review, and assign @stuartc or
   @taylordowns2000.

### Working with adaptors

#### 1. Setup

- Make sure you have the OpenFn CLI tool installed
  (`npm install -g @openfn/cli`). You'll need this to use and test your adaptor.

- Tell the OpenFn CLI where this repo is by setting the `OPENFN_ADAPTORS_REPO`
  environment variable to the local path. For example, if you've cloned this
  repo into `/repo/openfn/adaptors`, then in your `.bashrc` file, add
  `export OPENFN_ADAPTORS_REPO=/repo/openfn/adaptors`.

- Generate your own adaptor. `pnpm generate youradaptorname`

- Install your dependencies `pnpm install`

#### 2. Create a job with the operation you'd like to add, and run it so it fails

- Create a tmp folder where you can test your operation manually by running a
  job: `mkdir tmp`. Note: this tmp folder is included in .gitignore, so it will
  not be pushed to github.
- Create a job file `touch tmp/job.js` which calls the operation you would like
  to add. For example, if you were adding an operation which gets the weather
  forecast, it might look something like this:

```
getTodaysWeather(25.52, 13.41);
```

- Run your job with `openfn tmp/job.js -O -ma youradaptorname`

  `-O` will output to your console

  `-m` will run the job from the monorepo (see the setup notes in 1.)

  `-a` this will specify the adaptor to run your job with

- The job should fail - we haven't build the adaptor yet! Let's go do that.

#### 3. Create your adaptor function

- Head to `src/Adaptor.js`, and define your first function.

Adaptor functions are invoked with several arguments, and return a function
which accepts and returns state.

They should look something like this:

```js
export function yourFunctionName(arguments) {
  return state => {
    // logic
    return state;
  };
}
```

The logic is where you will prepare your API request. Build the URL, passing in
any arguments if needed. Then, using a helper function in common, return the
fetch request, making sure you set the Authorization, passing in any secrets
from `state.configuration`.

```js
import { get } from '@openfn/language-common/util';

export function getTodaysWeather(latitude = 25.52, longitude = 13.41) {
  return state => {
    const url = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current_weather=true&hourly=temperature_2m,relativehumidity_2m,windspeed_10m`;

    const headers = {
      Authorization: `${state.configuration.username}:${state.configuration.password}`,
    };
    const result = await get(url, { headers });
    return { ...state, data: result.body };
  };
}
```

- Define the configuration schema in `configuration-schema.json`

  This defines required parameters and their expected values for configuring the
  adaptor's authentication and authorization settings.

  1. Open the configuration file of the newly generated adaptor,
     `configuration-schema.json`.
  2. Specify the required parameters and their data types (these will be any
     values in state.configuration you are using in your adaptor function).
     Include descriptions that explain the purpose and usage of each parameter.
  3. If certain parameters are optional, clearly indicate their optional status
     and provide default values or instructions for their usage.
  4. Validate the configuration against the schema to ensure that the provided
     values match the expected structure and data types. This validation can be
     done tools like
     [JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/)

1. Set your new package `name`, `version`, `description`, and `build`
   definitions in your new `package.json`.

#### 4. Test it manually

- Make sure to run build again
- Run your job `openfn tmp/job.js -O -ma youradaptorname`
- Make sure it returns what you expect
- You can delete this folder once you have finished testing your job manually

#### 5. Write your unit tests

Import your newly defined function

```js
import { functionName } from '../src/Adaptor.js';
```

Describe your test, define state, call your operation (follow the example below
to see how state should be passed to it).

Make an assertion to check the result.

```js
it('should xyz', async () => {
const state = {
  configuration: {},
  data: {},
};

const result = await getTodaysWeather()(state);
```

Run `pnpm test` to check your test is passing.

Make sure to test your function with different arguments and values.

#### 6. Add docs and write the tests

- Include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comments to provide a clear and
  comprehensive explanation of the adaptor function's purpose, parameters,
  return values, and usage examples
- Update the adaptor's `README.md` to include a sample operation

## Changesets

Any submitted PRs should have an accompanying
[`changeset`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

A changeset is a text file with a list of what you've changed and a short
summary. Changesets are stored in a temporary folder until a release, at which
point they are merged into the changelogs of the affected packges.

Adding a changeset is really easy thanks to a very friendly CLI.

To create a changeset, run this from the repo root:

```
pnpm changeset
```

Look in the `.changesets` folder to see your change.

Commit the changeset to the repo when you're ready.

Note that the newly generated adaptor should ideally never have its version
increased - it should be locked at `1.0.0`.

## Releases

New releases will be published to npm automatically when merging into the `main`
branch`.

Version numbers should be bumped with `changeset` and git tags should be pushed
to the release branch BEFORE merging.

1. Run `pnpm changeset version` from root to bump versions
1. Run `pnpm install`
1. Commit the new version numbers
1. Run `pnpm changeset tag` to generate tags
1. Push tags `git push --tags`

Remember tags may need updating if commits come in after the tags are first
generated.

When ready, merge the branch to main and a Github Action will trigger the
release.

## Pre-releases

**NOTE: pre-release automation is currently DISABLED until support is activated
in Lightning**

Pre-release builds for adaptors are availabe with the `@next` tag. These can be
used in the CLI and Lightning and are generally available on `npm` (but because
they're not flagged as `latest`, they won't be downloaded by default).

Old pre-release versions will be deprecated when a new tag is published.

Pre-releases are available for any non-draft PR with at least one changeset.

The pre-release build will be updated when:

- A PR is opened in a non-draft state
- A new commit is pushed
- A changeset is added

Pre-releases will be given the correct next version number (the number that
`pnpm changeset version` will generated), plus the suffix `-next-<sha>`, where
sha is teh short github SHA for the commit.

Note that the Worker and CLI will both always download the latest versions of
the adaptor with the `@next` tag - it's a rolling tag and should always be up to
date.

## Build tooling

The `build` command accepts a list of build steps as arguments: `ast`, `src`,
`docs` and `dts`. Calling build on an adaptor with no arguments will build
everything.

Add `--watch` to watch the `src` for changes and rebuild this dist. This is
useful when developing with the CLI.

You can also watch with `build docs`, ie:

```
pnpm -C adaptors/http build docs --watch
```

Each adaptor's build command should simply call `build-adaptor` with the package
name.

You can run `build --help` for more information.

Examples:

```
pnpm -C packages/salesforce build --watch
```

### Docs

Docs are generated from the JSDoc annotations in adaptors. They are output as
markdown files in the `./docs` directly and not checked in to source control.

The markdown output can be customized by overriding the built-in handlebars
templates in jsoc2md.

- Find the template you want to customise in [j2sdoc2md source()
  https://github.com/jsdoc2md/dmd/tree/master/partials) (this can be tricky)
- Copy the template contents
- Paste into a file with the same name (this is important) in
  `tools/build/src/partials`
- Edit `tools/build/src/commands/docs.ts` and add the path to your new template
  to jsdoc2md's `renderOpts` (see how the other .hbs files are loaded in)
- Make your changes
- Run `pnpm build docs` from root (or just one adaptor folder) and inspect the
  generated `docs/index/md` file.

Once built, the docs need to be compiled into a JSON file to be published to the
docs site. This is run automatically through github actions.

For local dev against the docsite, you can run `pnpm docs:build` to rebuild your
local `docs.json` file. Use `pnpm docs:watch` to watch for md changes in
packages/\* and rebuild automatically.

## Metadata

Check the Wiki for the metadata creation guide:
[https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/Magic-Metadata](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/Magic-Metadata)

There are two CLI utils you can run to generate metadata and populate mock data.

Use `generate` to create a metadata.json based on the provided config. This will
be saved to `packages/<adaptorName>/src/meta/metadata.json`.

Use `populate-mock` to execute the `populate-mock-data.js` file and save the
results into the meta/data dir. Unit tests will use this mock data.

```
pnpm metadata generate <adaptorName> <path/to/config> pnpm metadata
populate-mock <adaptorName> <path/to/config>
```

Config paths can point to JSON or JS files with a default export. They are
always specified relative to the adaptor directory.

You can run these from the repo root or from the adaptor folder.

## Migration Guide

Any old adaptors should be copied/cloned into this repo, with all build, lint
and git artifacts removed and the package.json updated.

This checklist walks you through the process.

**IMPORTANT**: before starting the migration process, please make sure all open
pull-requests are merged or closed (maybe discuss with authors / responsibles)

First, create a new branch for your work:

```
git checkout -b migrate\_<name>
```

Then, copy the adaptor into `packages/<name>` (ignoring the `language-` prefix,
ie, `language-http` -> `http`). You can `cd` into `package` and `git clone`
straight from github if you like.

Next, from the `adaptors` root folder, run the migration script:

```
pnpm migrate <name>
```

For example, `pnpm migrate http`.

Then, from inside your new `packages/<name>`:

- Remove the `.git` directory
- Commit your changes `git commit -am "cloned <name> into monorepo"`
- Delete `package-lock.json`
- Remove `bundledDependencies` from package.json
- Make sure `"rimraf": "^3.0.2"` is in `devDependencies`
- Fix index.js (see `index.js` below)
- Run `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm build`
- Remove the `docs` and `lib` dirs
- Remove `.prettierrc`
- Remove any references to `babel` (ie, `.babelrc`) and `esdoc` (ie,
  `esdoc.json`)
- Remove the `.gitignore` file (update the top level ignore if necessary)
- Remove the `Makefile`
- Remove the `.devcontainer`
- Remove the `.tool-versions`
- Rename `crendential-schema.json` file to `configuration-schema.json`
- Remove the all files related to Travis CI (`travis.yml`, `.travis.yml`, ...)
- Update the readme (see the `Readme` below)
- Fix unit tests (see `Tests` below)
- run `git add packages/<name>` from the root folder to allow pnpm to detect
  `<name>` as changed package
- run `pnpm changeset` from the repo root to register a changeset (add a minor
  version bump for the package).
- Commit your changes, including the changeset, and open a pull request against
  `main`.

**IMPORTANT**:

- Make sure all open issues are transfered to the
  `https://github.com/openfn/adaptors` repositiory and labelled as the name of
  the source adaptor name. For example issues coming from `language-postgres`
  should have the label `postgres`.
- Update the adaptor repository readme to add archive note
- Archive the adaptor if you can
- Update the adaptor readme to indicate where the package has been moved to
  adaptors repo. See example below

```
# _⚠️ MOVED TO [OpenFn/adaptors](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors)! ⚠️_

**N.B.: New versions are available at:
https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/tree/main/packages/<name>**

# Language <name> (Archived)
```

### index.js

The index.js file should be exactly this:

```

import \* as Adaptor from './Adaptor'; export default Adaptor;

export \* from './Adaptor';

```

The first two lines export the Adaptor object as the default export from the
module, so you can do `import common from '@openfn/common'`

The second line exports every export of Adaptor from the main index, so you can
do `import { fn } from '@openfn/common'`.

### Readme

The readme probably has a section called "Development".

Replace this section with:

```
## Development

Clone the [adaptors monorepo](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors). Follow the
`Getting Started` guide inside to get set up.

Run tests using `pnpm run test` or `pnpm run test:watch`

Build the project using `pnpm build`.

To just build the docs run `pnpm build docs`

```

In addition, you may need to replace any references to `npm` with `pnpm`

### Tests

You'll need to update tests and get them passing.

Instead of importing test files from `lib`, import directly from `src`.

Ie, replace `import Adaptor from '../lib/Adaptor'` becomes
`import Adaptor from '../src/Adaptor'`
