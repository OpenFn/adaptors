## 2.0.0 - 01 August 2024

The 2.0 version of common removes axios and re-writes the `http` namespace.

You can now use `http.request()` from any adaptor that exports it:

```
http.request(
  'GET',
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos',
  http.options().basic('user', 'pass')
)
```

`http.get()` and `http.post()` are also available.

These functions behave just like the HTTP adaptor's operations (except that they
don't handle auth for you).

Use the `http.options()` helper functiosn to set basic auth headers and set the
content type to JSON.

### Major Changes

- Replace axios-based http operations with cleaner, undici-based ones
- Removed axios export

- Add options helpers to http namespace

## 1.12.0 - 24 January 2024

### Minor Changes

- 7f52699: New HTTP helper functions have been added to common in
  `src/util/http.js`

  These are based on the `undici` library. They are functions, not operations,
  so they do not get and return state, and do not expand references.

  They are designed to be used by other adaptors to make HTTP requests easier.

  ## Usage

  ```
  // Import the helper function
  import { get } from '@openfn/language-common/util'

  // This is an example operation
  export function get(id, callback) {
    return async (state) => {
      const [resolvedId] = expandReferences(
        state,
        id,
      );

      // Call the new common helper to fetch some json
      const response = await get(`www.example.com/resource/{$resolvedId}`, { parseAs: 'json' });

      // Return the response body as data, and also include the response object as a convenience
      return {
        ...state,
        response,
        data: response.body
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  See the http adaptor for a reference implementation.

  ## Deprecation notice

  The existing http operations in `src/http.js` have been deprecated, and
  adaptors should migrate to the new helpers.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c1d603: Remove parameter reassignment to ensure proper functioning inside an
  `each` block; add eslint

  The packages receiving a major bump here exposed functions that didn't work as
  expected inside `each` blocks. Users were previously wrapping these functions
  inside their own custom `fn` blocks, and this change will ensure that they can
  be used inside a standard each.

  See https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/issues/275 for more details.

Bumped all package versions to their latest.

# v0.0.4

- Added `arrayToString` helper.\
  Allowing you to join an array of string'able primitives (strings and integers)
  into a string.
- Added `toArray` helper.\
  This can be used to coerce certain types of data into an array, this can be useful
  when the source data has an ambiguous format. For example a given key in the data
  may have an object as it's value (when there is only one item), and an array of
  objects when there is more than one. `toArray` can be used to reconcile this inconsistency.
